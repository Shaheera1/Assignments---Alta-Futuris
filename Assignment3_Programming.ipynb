        " **Answer:** Walrus operator is the coolest feature that was added in the Python 3.8 update, the Python release that most of you are probably using right now. The operator := is called the walrus operator since it characterizes the look of the walrus. Assignment expressions allow you to assign and return a value in the same expression. For example, if you want to assign to a variable and print its value, then you typically do something like this:\n",

        " >>> walrus = False\\\n",
        " print(walrus)\\\n",
        "False\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python 3.8 and above, youâ€™re allowed to combine these two statements into one, using the walrus operator:\n",
